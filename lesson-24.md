### What is a “component”?

1. A "component" is a self-contained and reusable module or building block of software that performs a specific function or task

### What are the characteristics of a component?

2. Characteristics of a component:
   o Encapsulation: Components hide their internal details and expose a well-defined interface.
   o Reusability: Components can be reused in different parts of an application or in various applications.
   o Interoperability: Components can work with other components and technologies.
   o Replaceability: Components can be replaced with minimal impact on the system.
   o Independence: Components are independent units with their own state and behavior.

### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

3. Advantages of using component-based architecture:
   o Reusability: Components can be reused, reducing development time and effort.
   o Maintainability: Changes and updates to a single component have limited impact on the entire system.
   o Scalability: Components can be added or removed to accommodate changing requirements.
   o Interoperability: Components can be integrated with different technologies and platforms.
   o Parallel Development: Teams can work on different components concurrently, speeding up development.

### What is “props” short for?

"Props" is short for "properties" in React.

### How are props used in React?

o Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. They are typically defined as attributes in JSX elements and provide information that the child component needs to render.

### What is the flow of props?

o The flow of props is unidirectional, from parent to child. Parent components pass props to their child components, which can then access and use this data to render content or make decisions in their own rendering process. Child components cannot directly modify the props they receive; they are read-only.
