### What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. Code completion.
2. Syntax highlighting.
3. A nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue).
4. The ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.

### What do the following commands do?

* 'pwd' (Print Working Directory): This command prints the current working directory, which is the directory you are currently located in within the file system. It shows you the full path to your current location.

* 'ls' (List): The ls command is used to list the files and directories in the current directory. When you run ls without any arguments, it displays the contents of the current directory.

* 'cd' (Change Directory): The cd command is used to change your current directory. You can provide it with the name of a directory to navigate to. For example, cd /path/to/directory will change your current directory to the one specified.

* 'mkdir' (Make Directory): This command is used to create a new directory (folder) within the current directory or at a specified path. For example, mkdir new_folder creates a new directory named "new_folder" in the current directory.

* 'touch': The touch command is used to create a new empty file with a specified name. For example, touch new_file.txt will create a new empty text file named "new_file.txt" in the current directory.

### Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

* 'cd projects' - Change Directory is used to change current directory to the 'projects' directory.

* 'mkdir new-project' - This command creates a new directory (folder) named "new-project" within the current directory.
  
* 'touch new-project/newfile.md' - This command creates a new empty text file named "newfile.md".
  
* 'cd ..' - This command moves you up one directory level. 

* 'ls projects/new-project' - This command lists the contents of the "new-project" directory.
