# Structure of web pages

### What is HTML and why do we use it?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. HTML is used to define the elements and their layout on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more. It provides a way to structure and organize content on the internet, making it accessible to web browsers and enabling users to view and interact with web pages.

### What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

Opening Tag: The opening tag is the first part of an HTML element and is enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). It defines the start of the element and often includes attributes that provide additional information about the element.

Content: The content is the actual information or text that the HTML element represents. It is placed between the opening tag and the closing tag of the element.

Closing Tag: The closing tag is the last part of an HTML element and is also enclosed in angle brackets (</ and >). It defines the end of the element. Not all HTML elements have closing tags; some are self-closing or void elements.

### What is it called when you give an element extra information?

When you give an element extra information, you are adding "attributes" to that element. Attributes provide additional details or settings for an HTML element. For example, you can add attributes like href to a link (<a>) element to specify the URL it should link to, or you can add src to an image (<img>) element to specify the source file of the image.

### What is a semantic element?

In HTML, semantic elements are elements that convey meaning about the structure and content of a web page to both the browser and the developer. Semantic elements are used to define the purpose or role of specific parts of a web page, making the HTML code more readable and understandable. Examples of semantic elements include <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, <aside>, and others. Semantic HTML is important for accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and maintaining a clear and organized structure in web documents.
